# Java-Quiz

## Description

We were tasked with creating a multiple choice coding quiz. Using javascript the html and css were updated dynamically. Once the use clicks the start button the quiz the first question will be displayed, and the timer will begin to decrease. The questions are displyed one at a time. Once the user chooses an answer they will be presented with the next question. They will also be notified whether their answer was correct or incorrect. Incorrect answers will subtract 10s off the timer. Once the user answers the final question the time remaining will be displayed as thier final score. The user will then enter their initials/name and save that score to a high score list. The user can then either retry the quiz and a new score the the highscore list, or they can choose to clear the existing highscores.
